# rust-state-machine-blockchain

Rust project creating a Blockchain State machine inspired from Polkadot SDK in high-level for studying ;)

> WIP..

## Requirements

- Rust/cargo (MUST)
- crate cargo-expand (only required if you want to see the macro generated code)

## How to run/test

The main has a code sample interacting and printing the runtime at the end, see:

```bash
cargo run
```

Execute all tests:

```bash
cargo test
```

To visualize the macros output:

```bash
cargo expand
```
